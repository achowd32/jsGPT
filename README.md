# jsGPT
A basic implementation of NanoGPT written in TensorflowJS. Work in progress.

## Purpose
1. To assist with my assigned research project, which involves creating a pipeline for training LLMs in the shell.
2. To get more familiar with popular ML frameworks by porting components across them.
3. To create a point of reference for users looking to get started with TensorflowJS (which is lacking in online tutorials and documentation), as the code here can easily be compared to the original NanoGPT.
4. To hopefully integrate this into a web project and practice a little web development.

This project is a reimplementation of NanoGPT, outlined by Andrej Karpathy in this [video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=1riNNp8rxrVCGeZs).
