    <h1> What is jsGPT? </h1>
    <p> jsGPT is a project that seeks to implement various model architectures in TensorflowJS, most notably NanoGPT. By implementing small, easy-to-understand, and easily trainable architectures, jsGPT is especially useful to beginners hoping to understand the basics of modern machine learning. </p>
    <h1> What is the jsGPT Lab? </h1>
    <p> This website, also known as the jsGPT Laboratory, is a place where users can easily experiment with the models that have so far been implemented in jsGPT. Simply tune the hyperparameters to your liking, and see the model train in real time, with outputs for you to analyze once training is complete. </p>
    <h1> How does this site work? Is there a backend? </h1>
    <p> Nope! This is a fully frontend project, made possible by TensorflowJS. By using TensorflowJS, you train models on your own machine. Leveraging the power of WebGPU, jsGPT is able to train models quickly entirely without a backend! This does mean you are responsible if you try training a model with some crazy hyperparameters, though. Don't fry your GPU please. </p>
    <h1> Can I see the source code? </h1>
    <p> Of course, it's right <a href="https://github.com/achowd32/jsGPT">here</a>! Please star the repository if you like my work, and feel free to refer me to your tech company's summer internship.</p>
